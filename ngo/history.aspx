            <b style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</b>The Founder Mr.M.C.Ramesh hails from Mandur 
            village. He born and brought in this village and came to Bangalore for higher 
            studies. While doing his post graduate degree in Master of Social Work (M.S.W) 
            in Bangalore University in the year 1991, his friends Mr. Mr.B.C.Patil &amp; 
            Mr.Shivappa had a discussion about their future plans after completion of their 
            professional course. During the discussion, Mr.M.C.Ramesh was felt that since 
            they had exposure visits to various voluntary organizations, why not we all as a 
            collective, initiate a development organization to give back our knowledge and 
            skills to the needy people in our society particularly the rural masses.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em;">
            &nbsp;It is a not a sudden idea of Mr.M.C.Ramesh, it was there in his mind during his 
            high school days too. So when his friends and he were talking about their 
            dreams, he expressed his idea and it was supported by his friends. Thus 
            “Vidyaranya” came into existence on 29<sup 
                style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">th</sup><span 
                class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>October 1991 in the village Mandur the 
            native place of Mr.M.C.Ramesh.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; text-align: justify;">
            &nbsp;At the outset, the team felt that they could focus on health and sanitation and 
            conducted awareness programmes for the Mandur villagers and also carried out a 
            survey for constriction of house for houseless people and submitted a proposal 
            to CAPART, New Delhi and got sanctioned 25 houses and built houses for the 
            neediest people.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; text-align: justify;">
            &nbsp;While working with this project, the team found that the children with special 
            needs were not access to the education and they were looked as unproductive by 
            their parents and communities and thought of approaching DSERT, Bangalore for 
            the execution of “Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC)” a programme 
            finically supported by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), New 
            Delhi and submitted a proposal to them for 32 various categories of children 
            with special needs such as Mentally Challenged (MR), Visually Impaired (VI), 
            Hearing Impaired (HI) and Orthopedically Handicapped (OPH) with one Resource 
            Teacher.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; text-align: justify;">
            &nbsp;Now the organization has been focusing in 5 districts such as Bangalore Urban, 
            Bangalore Rural, Hassan, Chikkaballapur and Ramanagar of Karnataka and has been 
            executing different developmental programmes for women, aged, persons with 
            differently abled, orphans, street children, slum children, adolescent girls, 
            youths, farmers etc on education, economic, social, health, environment, 
            ecology, cultural, welfare programmes for the aged, Persons With Disabilities, 
            women empowerment, livelihood, energy, community property resources, water 
            issues, agriculture etc.</p>
